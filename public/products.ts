      "Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica. They are most closely related to snakes, from which they evolved around 200 million years ago. The earliest known lizard fossils date to the Jurassic Period, making them some of the oldest reptile species on Earth.",

    description:
      "Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes. Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with many more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.",

Turtles are one of the oldest reptile groups and a more ancient group than snakes or crocodilians. Of the 356 known species alive today, some are highly endangered.",
